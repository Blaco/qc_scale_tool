# qc_scale_tool
#### Powershell tool that applies $scale to a QC and VRD and changes all calculations to work with it
#### Never sacrifice jigglebones and procedural helpers ever again because you need to scale an SFM model


## Instructions:
1. Place in the same directory as your QC and VRD files, right click > Run with Powershell.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your file and options, the tool does all the work.
3. Compile and enjoy your newely scaled model produced in literally 10 seconds.

# Notes:
The tool will detect and warn you about VTA files and $EyeRadius, both of which cannot be scaled.

Be sure your VRD file has the correct values for the scale your QC is currently set to before first use!
